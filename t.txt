Your plan and document structure is good and i think its suitable for my YODO README.md. I will refine and enhance the plan and structure of the document.
You can generate the documentation of all 9 points you listed.

Before continuing i have to pass all the necessary information to you for generating the README.md.
You already know much about YODO, its features, things to be documented and other logics and important things, but still there some information are missing.
i will give you all the necessary information about YODO inorder to prepare README.md. Means i will re-define the structure of document file.

Below is the updated structure of document preparation plan (I only included missing parts, i avoided explaning things that you already know about YODO):


1) USAGE PART:
• Already explained in REDAME.md, but need improvements.
• In the current README.md file, it only explained 'update' was used to update both yodo and yt-dlp. But update keyword is more powerful than as it described in document.
'update' can be used in the place of entering URL (means, instead entering url after user starts the yodo program, they can pass 'update' keyword and additional arguments along with itself.
Usage:
update [yodo] [yt-dlp] [nightly]
(Im not explaning how update logic works, i think you already know that)


(From now on, I'm not detaily explaining additional information needed in the next 2-9 points. I will only pass the necessary information that you already don't know. Because other things already well described in your plan/document structure)


2) CLI Mode (Arguments)
• usage: yodo [-h] [-d] [-v] [--download-dir PATH] [--version]
• options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug          Enable debug mode (shows internal details)
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output
  --download-dir PATH  Set custom download directory
  --version            show program's version number and exit
  

3) Environment Variables
• Default download directory:
For Android: '/storage/emulated/0/YODO/'
For Linux: '$HOME/YODO/'
• All audio files are stored in '.../audio/'
All video files are stored in '.../video/'
Under specified DOWNLOAD_DIR
E.g: '/storage/emulated/0/YODO/audio/....'


4) Download Directory Resolution
(Your plan is already good, no refinements or additional information needed)


5) Examples
(Your plan is already good. I can additionally include screenshots, but not now, maybe in future updates)


6) Configuration & Behavior Notes
• Why project directory is protected?
Answer: (You already know)
• Why Windows is unsupported
Answer:
Explain to user that, As a developer im currently and specifically working for Termux environment, i have limited access to Windows environment for developing and testing, and most of the users are using Termux and Linux. Windows support may be added in future updates
• 3rd question and answer: you already know


7) Troubleshooting
Additionally:
• YouTube throttling and temporal ban issues, use trusted vpn to fix
• Other commonly seen yt-dlp or YouTube specific issues and fix.


8) FAQ (Short)
(your plan is already good)


9) Notes & Limitations
• Platform limitations - no windows support and limited compatibility in some Linux distributions
• No option to pass cookies to yt-dlp through YODO (cookies implementation is avoided because its very hard to pass cookies in Android (Termux) environment, therefore i skipped.


Once again the above points are additional information that i shared with you inorder to prepare and improve README. Dont skip the points you already defined in your plan (document structure).
Final README.md preparation plan = Your Plan (document structure) + My plan and enhancements
